1. As an astronomy novice I would like to know when the ISS will be visible from my backyard so I can see it for the first time

2. As an astronomy novice I would like to see how big the ISS is compared to my house so I can have a better idea of what I'm looking at. 

3. As an astronomy novice I would like to learn an interesting fact about space so I can know more about this neat subject.

4. As an astronomy photographer I would like to know when the ISS will pass overhead while the weather is clear so I have multiple opportunities to take good photos.
